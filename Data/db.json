In one cave, Hilda meets a giant troll called Trundle (Dino Kelly), who promises to help her change back into a human in exchange for a few favors. While she works out how to help Trundle, she starts to enjoy the freedom and strength of being a troll running free in the mountains at night. But she still wants to get back to her real mom more than anything. Meanwhile, the people of Hilda's town feel more and more threatened by trolls each day, and start to ramp up security and build giant, troll-fighting weapons.
